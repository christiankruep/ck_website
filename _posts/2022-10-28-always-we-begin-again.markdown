This is the initial post of version 2.0 of my website. It’s been a minute since I’ve done much of anything with this site. I’ve been meaning to get around to updating it for some time but as it does, Life got in the way. The old site wasn’t anything special. I made it myself, which is a way of saying I cobbled it together using the HTML and CSS I learned in college. The whole thing was a bodge job intended to be a learning experience, one that has long served its purpose. Now it’s time take the old site behind the woodshed, old yeller it and move on.

Anyway, this is the new site. Its built using Jekyll and is hosted by AWS. Its theme is [Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout). I figured that I didn’t have to reinvent the wheel by coding a website from scratch. If I did it would most likely end up as a big pile of spaghetti and looking about as pretty as an old soviet apartment building. Using Jekyll provides a good jumping off point. 

At the moment there isn’t much on here, but I intend to do more with this version of the site as its easier to interact with and make updates to.  

That’s all for now.
