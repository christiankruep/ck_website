Welcome <br>

This is the repository for version “2.0” of my personal website, christiankruep.com. The old version was a homemade bodge job built using HTML and CSS. Click [here](https://github.com/christiankruep/PersonalWebsite) if you want to see its archived repository. Eventually the old version grew clunky making it hard to interact with and make updates to. Because of that when I started the overhaul of the site, I knew I wanted to use a framework that could help build a lightweight static site that was easier to update easy to tailor. I didn’t want to build a site from scratch. 

Christiankruep.com uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate and render the site. It uses [Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) as its theme. The site is hosted on AWS using amplify.
