# christiankruep.com 2.0

### Welcome <br>

This is version “2.0” of my personal website, [christiankruep.com](christiankruep.com). The old version was a homemade bodge job built using HTML and CSS. Click [here](https://github.com/christiankruep/PersonalWebsite) if you want to see its archived repository. Overtime the old version grew clunky making it hard to interact with and make changes to. Because of that I've overhauled the site using a framework helps create a lightweight static site that is easier to update and tailor.

Christiankruep.com uses Jekyll to generate and render the site. It is themed with Hydeout. The site is hosted using AWS Amplify. This GitHub repository is hooked up to Amplify to create a pipeline. Any changes commited are noticed by Amplify. When a change is a detected Amplify then clones, builds and deploys the updated version of the site automatically.
