## Welcome <br>

This is version “2.0” of my personal website, [christiankruep.com](christiankruep.com). The old version was a homemade bodge job built using HTML and CSS. Click [here](https://github.com/christiankruep/PersonalWebsite) if you want to see its archived repository. Eventually the old version grew clunky making it hard to interact with and make updates to. Because of that when I started the overhaul of the site, I knew I wanted to use a framework that could help build a lightweight static site that was easier to update easy to tailor. I didn’t want to build a site from scratch. 


christiankruep.com uses Jekyll to generate and render the site. It is themed with Hyedout. The site is hosted using AWS Amplify. This GitHub repository is hooked up to Amplify to create a pipeline. Any changes commited are noticed by Amplify. It then clones, builds and deploys the updated version of the site automatically.
