# Hello There!

I’m Christian Kruep and this is my personal website. I am originally from the San Francisco Bay area but I currenly reside in Salt Lake City, UT. In my free time I read, watch movies and depending on the season either bike or ski.
<br>

On here I have a blog and in the future I hope to add more content. 

If you want to learn how the site was built, [click here](https://github.com/christiankruep/ck_website). It’ll take you to the GitHub repository where the README explains what was used to create and host the site.
